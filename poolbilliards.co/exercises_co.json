As with the original 'L' Drill, position play is intended to be short draw shots to play position on each ball, but the key shot to this drill is getting the right position on the 3 to draw back off the near side rail and out to center table for the 4. This is the level 2 drill because of the emphasis on good cueball control and accuracy required, but much fewer balls on the table gives much more room for error in playing position. Enjoy and good luck.",

You advance to a higher Progress Class once you reach a score of +4. At that point an extra ball is added and you start with Progress Score equal 0. Make sure to always put the lowest numbered ball at the top, last ball in the middle of a rack and the rest of the balls in random positions.

        "ex_description": "The idea of this T-9 drill is to run the balls in rotation, but without moving any of the other balls with the cueball, when playing position on the next ball. The spin used in this drill is mostly follow (Top) english, but you may need a little left or right follow english, depending on the position of the cueball on your next shot and where you need the cueball to go, in order to get position on the next shot. This is a progressive drill and so, a beginner level player can start with the 1,2,3,4... then once that player is able to run them all consistently, then add the 5,6,7, and so on. Method of the drill:- 1, 4, 7 balls to be made on the lower right corner pocket, 2, 5, 8 balls to be made in the upper right corner 3, 6, 9 balls to be made in the lower left corner. Purpose of the drill:- The purpose of this drill is to learn how to become familiar with the speed of the cloth and rails of the table and to be able to adapt quickly to how the table's playability, but also it is important to know how to minimize cueball movement when playing position on the next ball, reguardless of the game you play being 9Ball/10Ball or Straight Pool/14.1. It's a great drill and it is a good way to help 'fine tune' your cueball control. I hope you enjoy this drill and I have alot more drills to share and so, be sure to stay tuned for more drills to take to the tale and try out.",

Drill Variations:- For Level 1 players, try this drill with 1, 2, 3, 4 all on the centre diamonds on the side rails and run them out. For Level 2 players, try this drill with 1,2,3,4,5,6 balls on the centre diamond of each rail as shown and again, try to run the balls consistently at least 5 times before moving to the next level. I will add the level 4 & 5 variations of this drill at a later time, but for now I hope you enjoy this drill.",

This is also to show you that working on one drill doesn't mean playing the same shots all the time. Frequently, you're actually forced to adjust spin & speed to stay in-line when you don't achieve intended positions. This layout requires moving the cue ball up & down the table so on these shots it's very important to get an optimal shape or you have to make it up with recovery shots. Practise this layout until you can clear it up most of the times. If you go through all the 4 variations several times you'll notice that it improves your game pretty quickly.",

This is the level 3 drill because of the emphasis on good cueball control and accuracy required, but fewer balls on the table and larger spacing gives a slightly larger margin for error in playing position.

This is the level 4 drill because the emphasis on good cueball control and accuracy required in not just shooting bank shots and making them, but is slightly easier due to the lesser number of balls to make successfully.

You just need to imagine a line from a \"ghost ball\" to a cue ball and extend this line through the head string. The point where you hit the head string is where the cue ball will go if you hit the cueball with a nice smooth follow shot. The margin of error is usually 3-4 balls width. Have fun by practicing these nice reference shots which also work fine if an object ball is near the foot spot. Rated it level 4, because a really repeatable stroke is needed here.

This drill will make you aware of your tip position, stroke and power you play shots with. For instance, the first shot you can play with different strokes. Aiming all the way south you can play the shot much softer then when you're aiming just one tip below center ball. I want you to be aware of all the different variables that are possible. Play with speed, stroke and tip position and become more aware of your abilities. Have fun.",

The shooting order is as follows:- Cueball between 2 & 3 - Masse around the 2 to pocket the 1 - put 2ball at the pocket. Cueball between 3 & 4 - Masse around the 3 to pocket the 2 put 3ball at the pocket. Cueball between 4 & 5 - Masse around the 4 to pocket the 3 put 4ball at the pocket. Cueball between 5 & 6 - Masse around the 5 to pocket the 4 put 5ball at the pocket.... and so on until the 14 ball is pocketed... when the 14 ball is pocketed, place the 1ball 1/2 diamond up the rail from the 15, then have the cueball behind the 1 and the 15 at the corner pocket... once you have been able to masse around the 1 to make the 15, you have completed the drill. It's a challenging drill to play, but can be alot of fun and it's worth setting this up in a few different ways to help you become more skilled at recognising how much or little cue power and spin is needed to make the shots. I hope you enjoy taking this one to the table and good luck. Willie Dines",

On each shot you get a ball in hand from the shaded kitchen area. If any object ball rolls on the kitchen you are not allowed to play it directly but you can kick it out when potting another ball. That forces a soft break because kicking the ball out of the kitchen is far from easy - you will find out. Scratch or accidental pot to the side ends the inning. This game greatly improves semi-distance shots but also creativity, planning and cueball control as very accurate collisions are necessary. To complete the full rack it requires superb consistency. Once you make it, rack another one and go for a high run just like in straight pool and compare with your club rivals. Good luck! Tip: I break from the side of the table as shown on the diagram, into the second ball (8-ball here). Balls tend to spread more on one side and it allows you to play them and kick the rest on the other side that is clearer.",
